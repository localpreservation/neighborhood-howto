# Introduction

##Purpose of this guide

How to Look at Your Neighborhood is intended to assist residents and neighborhood organizations in analyzing the physical character and strengths of the neighborhood in which they live or which they represent. The guide has three primary objectives, reflecting the mission and programs of the Preservation Alliance.

To assist residents and neighborhood organizations:

1. identifying the distinctive physical characteristics of their neighborhood worthy of preservation, including historic buildings and potential historic or conservation districts that might be appropriate to include in a citywide preservation plan for Philadelphia.
2, identifying the distinctive physical characteristics and strengths of their neighborhood and define projects for grant applications to the Preservation Alliance or others.
3. identifying the distinctive physical characteristics of their neighborhood and historic resources that might be appropriate to include in District Plans prepared by the Philadelphia City Planning Commission.

The first objective may result in findings that lead to the nomination of buildings or districts to the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places to ensure that they are protected from demolition or adverse alteration, or to the creation of a conservation district or to the preparation of an application for an historic marker or to undertake other activities that explore and celebrate the history of the neighborhood. The analysis might also encourage residents to participate in workshops provided by the Alliance to learn how to maintain an historic property or to attend the Old House Fair.

The second objective is intended to assist residents and community organizations with completion of the analysis required to apply for a grant from the Preservation Alliance or others. A Preservation Alliance Guide for Community Organizations.

The third objective is intended to help residents and community organizations to be better prepared to work with the Philadelphia City Planning Commission on the development of a District Plan that will include their neighborhood. The City Planning Commission intends to create 18 District Plans covering the entire city over a period of five years. A map of the 18 districts and the City Planning Commission’s schedule can be found at www.phila2035.org.

The guide describes how to analyze a neighborhood and record certain basic information on maps supplemented by digital photographs. Appendix B illustrates how one neighborhood organization used the guide to prepare a submission to the Preservation Alliance.

## How to use this guide

Many neighborhood organizations have developed neighborhood plans working with professional consultants. These are valuable documents and contain valuable information. This guide is not intended to result in a neighborhood plan. It encourages a “grass-roots” approach to neighborhood analysis that can be undertaken by residents and may contribute to a neighborhood plan or to other purposes.

This guide encourages resident participation in the gathering of information about the neighborhood.

1. In order to develop a community consensus on neighborhood character, strengths and historic assets it is helpful to begin with as many different points of view on these issues as possible. The neighborhood analysis requires certain information be gathered by walking or driving around and looking at the neighborhood from a new perspective. For this part of the analysis we recommended that teams of community residents be organized with the number of teams dependent on the size of the neighborhood.
 - For a small neighborhood each team could examine the entire neighborhood, in which case it would be desirable to have two or three teams to be sure to get different points of view.
 - A larger neighborhood could be divided into two or three sections with two or three teams examining each section. The analysis can also be done by an individual. It is also an exercise that can be done by high school students or young adults, whose view of the neighborhood would be valuable to have. The objective of this stage of the process is to get as many different points of view on the components of the analysis as possible in order to see similarities and differences.
- Each team should produce the types of maps suggested in this guide and document its observations and conclusions with digital photographs that can be shared with the other teams.
- One part of the analysis requires an historical and current description of the neighborhood. This requires research, much of which can be done via the Internet, and might be completed by a separate team or an individual.
2. Once each team has completed its analysis, all teams should come together and each present the results of its analysis to the other participants. This might be done at a community meeting or in a workshop format with other residents participating who did not take part in the analysis. The objective is to create a community discussion about the character of the neighborhood by sharing observations and finding out where there is agreement and where there are differences of opinion that need to be discussed until consensus can be reached.
3. The results of this process can then be recorded in the format suggested in this guide as a community perspective on the neighborhood that can be shared with other residents. It can also contribute information to the Preservation Alliance’s development of an inventory of historic resources and potential historic districts, and that can serve as a basis for discussions with the City Planning Commission about a District Plan and zoning remapping.

## Components of the Process

The guide defines a step-by-step process for looking at your neighborhood by completing a series of exercises, each of which are described and then illustrated with an actual neighborhood example. The guide uses information about the Washington Square West neighborhood to illustrate the approach to each of the six components, while also introducing elements from other neighborhoods to help understand the broader range of architectural styles and building types found in Philadelphia neighborhoods.

The components of the suggested process are defined and illustrated in the chapters listed below. The first five chapters are most relevant to a general understanding of the neighborhood, to contributing data to the Preservation Alliance for a citywide preservation plan, for applying for a small grant from the Preservation Alliance, and for working with the City Planning Commission on District Plans. The sixth chapter is most relevant to organizations seeking a grant from the Preservation Alliance.

1. Defining Neighborhood Boundaries and Context
2. Describing Neighborhood History and Current Conditions
3. Defining General Land Use Patterns
4. Describing Residential Sub-areas and their Character
5. Identifying Historic Landmarks and Districts
6. Applying for a Grant from the Preservation Alliance

## Preparing a grant application to the Preservation Alliance

The Preservation Alliance provides grants ranging from $1,000 to $5,000 for neighborhood preservation projects and grants of $30,000 for neighborhood improvement projects or Service Grants in partnership with the Community Design Collaborative through its Vital Neighborhoods Initiative. Applicants for grants of $1,000 to $5,000 must complete some of the exercises in this guide to be eligible for a grant. Applicants for $30,000 must complete all of the exercises including those in Chapter Six. See Chapter Six for further information on grant application requirements.

# Defining Neighborhood Boundaries & Context

## Boundaries

Most neighborhoods in Philadelphia have clearly defined boundaries that are recognized by residents and often used by such public agencies as the City Planning Commission for planning, zoning or data gathering purposes. The City Planning Commission has recorded its understanding of neighborhood names and boundaries as part of its Community Profile maps. The Community Profile maps are located online at: www.philaplanning.org/data/datamaps.html

Neighborhood boundaries can be defined by many different types of conditions, including history and development of an area. However, most often boundaries are defined by physical characteristics and changes such as the following conditions.

### Major Streets

Major streets are the most common way to define a neighborhood boundary. Streets define clear edges that are easily recognized and remembered. Major streets often have different types of uses, such as greater density of commercial development, that often separate them in use and character from the adjacent neighborhoods. For example, Broad Street is often used as a boundary to define neighborhoods in North and South Philadelphia; Germantown Avenue and Market Street are also used to define neighborhood boundaries. One limitation in using streets as boundaries is that often both sides of the street exhibit the same character and it is therefore preferable to view the street itself as a unified area consisting of both sides of the street. This suggests that often it can be useful to define a neighborhood boundary by an intermediary street adjacent to a major street.

### Natural or Man Made Features

Natural features such as parks, rivers, streams or man-made features such as railroad lines are also used to define boundaries. Natural features are less common as boundaries for Philadelphia neighborhoods except where neighborhoods may border parts of the Fairmount Park system or where regional rail lines create clear divisions between one neighborhood and another.natural feature.

### Changes in Land use or Character

A change in land use from residential to commercial or industrial use might mark the boundary of a neighborhood and the start of another area. Changes in character, such as the change from single-family residential use to high-rise apartments or from a preponderance of row houses to a neighborhood of twin houses, might also create a boundary condition. A commercial corridor, such as major streets as noted above, might have an identity of its own and create a boundary for adjacent residential neighborhoods.

## Surrounding Context

A neighborhood is often influenced by other uses or activities that are adjacent but outside of its own boundaries. The presence of a university, a hospital or similar large institutions, for example, often influences the population of a neighborhood and can often result in physical change and development within a neighborhood. Proximity to a major transit interchange might also do the same. It is therefore useful to have a general understanding of the surrounding context of the neighborhood – the neighborhoods that are adjacent or major institutions, transportation or other special elements in the immediate area.

## Illustration

Map 1 on page 7 illustrates how to represent neighborhood boundaries and the surrounding context on a map, with simple explanatory notes. This map shows the Washington Square West neighborhood in Center City.

**Boundary:** Using major streets, the boundaries of Washington Square West would be Walnut Street, South Street, 13th Street and 8th Street. However, as noted above, often the use of major streets as boundaries overlooks the fact that both sides of the street are a unified area and should be included. Therefore, in some cases the boundaries shown on the map use secondary streets adjacent to major streets as boundaries to include or eliminate streets that are of different character or use than the neighborhood. For example, the map uses Watts Street as the western boundary rather than Broad Street.

**Surrounding Context:** The surrounding context is indicated by the names of adjacent neighborhoods or by identification of certain major landmarks or areas. For example, the Society Hill neighborhood is immediately to the east, the South Street commercial corridor immediately to south, the Center City commercial district along Walnut, Chestnut and Market streets is immediately to the north, and the Broad Street/Avenue of the Arts corridor is immediately to the west. All of these adjacent areas have some influence on the neighborhood.Special features in the context area are indicated by numbers on the map and identified in a key. These are places that are important to the neighborhood and include Washington Square, two supermarkets, proximity to The Gallery and the Market Street, Broad Street and PATCO subways and the Market East Regional Rail station.

## Execise 1: Define your neighborhood boundaries and context

Create a map of the surrounding boundaries and context of your neighborhood using the Washington Square West map as a model. Use a City Planning Commission base map and mark on it the boundaries that you think define the neighborhood*.* Then for the surrounding area indicate the names of adjacent neighborhoods or other uses or activities along the boundaries. Also locate major institutions, transportation or other places whose proximity is important to the neighborhood. Number those on the map with a key giving the name, address and type of use if necessary. The maps you create do not need to be computer-generated as are the maps in this guide. Carefully done hand-drawn maps can convey the same information.

### Resources

The following resources may help in defining neighborhood boundaries.City Planning Commission Community Profile mapsThese maps contain a great deal of information about Philadelphia neighborhoods including neighborhood names and boundaries, zip codes, wards and councilman district boundaries, population data and other useful information (See Section Two: Neighborhood Planning Sections and Political Divisions pgs. 13-83/pg. 104)

# Describe Neighborhood History & Current Condition

Philadelphia neighborhoods have grown and changed over long periods of time. Some neighborhoods date back to the 1700s and the founding of the city, others were created in the 19th and 20th centuries as the city expanded. In some cases many of the original buildings remain, in others, later periods of development have changed the area to what it is today. Old City, for example, was the earliest residential neighborhood of Philadelphia. Within its boundaries were houses, churches, shops, schools and other facilities. Over time, as the population moved westward, many of the older buildings were demolished and replaced by commercial buildings for wholesale and manufacturing use. In the mid-20th century those buildings were converted to apartments and condominiums. Neighborhoods today contain elements from many periods of growth and development. Understanding this history and the patterns of development of the neighborhood helps to identify what is important from the past to preserve. It also recognizes that neighborhoods continue to change, with new elements being added and older buildings often being adapted to uses very different from their original purpose.The history of Philadelphia neighborhoods is well documented in photographs, atlases and maps. Historic photographs give a sense of what the community was like in the past and often show buildings that once existed and have been replaced by subsequent development or how buildings have been adapted to other uses over time. Maps and atlases from different historic periods contain a wealth of information and are a fascinating way to examine the evolution of a neighborhood. One of the best sources for maps and atlases is the Greater Philadelphia Geo History Network’s website site. It contains maps and atlases from approximately the 1600s to the present time. Maps from different years may be superimposed on one another to see how a neighborhood and individual properties have changed over time.It is also important to understand how the population of a neighborhood has changed over time to show social and ethnic history and the places that may be associated with changing social and ethnic patterns. Census data for different historic periods provides basic data on population and demographic characteristics, and recent publications describe the movement of racial and ethnic groups from one section of the city to another.

Appendix A contains a short description of the history of the Washington Square West neighborhood. The description is organized by chronological periods with a brief description of the key changes that occurred at different points in time. It ends with a general description of the neighborhood today. The chronological time periods used in the Washington Square West example may not be applicable to all neighborhoods. It is important that the time periods identified are relevant to your specific neighborhood’s history. The written description is supplemented by historic maps and historic photographs. Appendix B contains a description of the history of the Belmont Village neighborhood also supplemented with historic maps.


## Exercise 2: Describe and Illustrate the History of Your Neighborhood

Using the Washington Square West example, located in Appendix A as a model, describe and illustrate the history and current condition of your neighborhood.

# Describe the General Land Use Patterns of Your Neighborhood

Most neighborhoods contain a mix of uses; few are 100% residential, although there are some neighborhoods in Philadelphia where that is true. Understanding the general pattern of land uses in a neighborhood is helpful to understanding what mixture of uses contribute to the character and resources of a neighborhood and what uses might be considered intrusions that detract from the neighborhood. An understanding of the general pattern of uses is also critical to understanding what zoning classifications will help to preserve appropriate uses or phase out inappropriate uses. For the purposes of this analysis there are eight broad categories of land use that are sufficient to understand the basic character of a neighborhood. Each of these is normally associated with a specific color on a land use map.

These are:

- **Residential** low density, detached and two to three story row homes (yellow)
- **Residential** high density, larger row homes and apartment buildings (orange)
- **Commercial** neighborhood commercial district (red)
- **Mixed Use** commercial and residential (purple)
- **Institutional** including schools, hospitals, government, religious
places (blue)
- **Industrial** including manufacturing(brown)
- **Open Space** including parks, recreation and cemeteries (green)
- **Parking** (gray)

Understanding general land use patterns does not require identification of every use in a neighborhood. For example, most neighborhoods have a variety of corner stores. Identifying each of these is too detailed for this exercise. The objective is to identify broad patterns — entire blocks that are predominantly one type of use or another. Often the easiest way to identify broad land use patterns is by driving the streets of the neighborhood and recording the dominant land uses along each street.

### Illustration

The map and key on the following page describe the general pattern of land uses for the Washington Square West neighborhood. As the map indicates, most of the area is residential. However, there are a variety of other uses including areas of institutional use (hospitals, education and religious use), parks and recreation and a small neighborhood commercial district that is entirely within the neighborhood boundaries. The key identifies the type of use and could include a brief description to clarify the activity located in that area of the neighborhood.

### Landuse photographs

- Low Density Residential
- Institutional
- Commercial
- Open Space
- High Density Residential
- Mixed Use

## Exercise 3: Create a Diagrammatic Land Use Map

Using the eight land use categories listed above, create a general land use map of your neighborhood similar to the one for Washington Square West. Describe each land use category and activity in the key. Include at least one digital photograph of each land use area.

### Resources

The City Planning Commission has maps indicating land use and zoning classification for all sections of the city. These maps can serve as a good starting point for examining the use of certain streets or blocks in a neighborhood.

# Describe Residential & Commercial Sub-Areas

Within most neighborhoods there are usually residential areas that vary somewhat from one to another. Some neighborhoods also have commercial corridors or districts. For this analysis these are referred to as sub-areas. The objective of this part of the analysis is to identify the residential sub-areas that have a distinctive character and that might be appropriate federal style for designation as historic or conservation districts (see Chapter 5) or that should be reflected in a District Plan and a zoning remapping plan for the neighborhood. The elements that characterize the physical environment of each sub-area should be described and illustrated with photographs. Residential sub-areas of a neighborhood may be defined by land use changes that create boundaries between one section of a neighborhood and another; they may be defined by changes in density (low density vs greek revival style high density housing) or changes in architectural character or differences in building quality and conditions. Residential buildings may be of different architectural styles. Philadelphia neighborhoods exhibit a wide variety of architectural styles that give neighborhoods a distinctive character. (See the Preservation Alliance’s Field Guide, listed in the Resource section of this chapter, to help identify the architectural styles in your neighborhood.)In describing residential sub-areas the objective is to identify those queen anne style elements that make up the common physical character of the area. In some neighborhoods houses consist of twins with front yards and porches or bay windows; in others houses consist of row houses built right to the front property line. Some neighborhoods have single-family houses on larger lots with open space and off-street parking. Some residential areas include narrow streets with two story houses in contrast to major streets with three and four story houses. These are the types of characteristics to identify and illustrate with digital photographs.Some neighborhoods have entire blocks that are often very distinctive in themselves and different in character than the residential area surrounding them. It is often useful to identify these and describe what makes them stand out as a way to see if these features can be replicated in other parts of the neighborhood. Often these features relate to a particular historical characteristic, like street paving, and or a landscape characteristic such as the presence of mature street trees.

- Commercial sub-areas consist of commercial corridors or streets whose character and functions are dominated by retail and businesses uses. Often these areas contain housing on the upper floors of buildings, but it is the commercial uses that are the dominant use in the area. These areas should also be described in terms of their physical characteristics and architectural styles.

## Illustration

The map and photographs on the following pages indicate that the Washington Square West neighborhood has ***seven ***residential sub-areas and one commercial sub area. The text provides a brief description of two of the sub-areas (areas \#1 and \#2) to illustrate the type of description that gives enough detail to understand the characteristics of the physical
environment. Most of Washington Square West consists of row houses, typically three or four stories on major streets and two or three stories
on smaller streets. However, to illustrate the diversity of architectural styles and housing types that are found in different Philadelphia neighborhoods, photographs of residential buildings from other neighborhoods are also included and described. A common housing type in many neighborhoods are twins, a pair of houses built side by side that share a common wall. This configuration creates two identical buildings in a single structure and not a continuous row of homes. Some common elements found on twins are front porches, projecting bay windows on the second story, dormer windows and decorative cornices. They can either be situated close to the street or set back allowing for a front yard and mature tree growth. The front porches typically contain a high level of detail including columns, balustrades and dentil trim and can be enclosed or open to the elements.Single-family or detached homes are also found in some Philadelphia neighborhoods in a range of styles and sizes. They are typically situated on larger plots of land allowing for bigger front yards and expansive porches. They can be constructed of stone, brick or wood and are often at least two stories in height. The entrance ways typically have a greater level of detail, such as decorative trim around the door with a pediment or fanlight window above the main entrance way. Decorative cornices and wood sash windows are also common features. Washington Square West also has some distinctive blocks. Many of these are the narrow streets with historic street paving. Others, like Portico Row on Spruce Street, exhibit architectural features not found on other houses in the area.

### Sub-Area Descriptions

Sub-Area 1: Clinton Street

The two blocks of Clinton Street from 9th to 11th streets are the most outstanding sub-area of the neighborhood. Houses are predominantly three stories tall with a raised first floor and basement windows at the sidewalk level. A few houses are four stories in height. The houses, built 1831-1837, are designed in the Federal style in brick with simple details, the porticos show a Greek Revival influence. The elements of the physical environment that make Clinton Street stand out are:- All the houses are very well maintained.- Almost all the houses have shutters on the first floor and many on the upper floors as well. While wood shutters were a typical historic feature of houses of this style and period, most of the houses in the neighborhood no longer have shutters. The presence of shutters on
these two blocks gives the houses an added distinction. - The sidewalks are brick, contributing to the feeling of an historic
block.- There are large street trees on both sides of the street, which is
not the case on many other streets. The trees shade the blocks in summer and contribute to the distinctive character. - Complimenting the street trees, residents have taken great care in landscaping the blocks, which is probably the feature that makes the blocks so distinctive. Almost all houses have window boxes that are carefully maintained and full of plants and flowers. In between the entrance steps of adjacent houses, which project into the sidewalk
area, planting beds can be found in front of many houses. These are also
well maintained with interesting plants and flowers. Even the areas around the base of the street trees have been planted. It is these features more than almost all others that contribute to Clinton Street’s
distinctive character.

***SuB-area 2: SMaLL StreetS, caMac and otherS ***Throughout the neighborhood are a number of small streets, usually north/ south streets in between the numbered streets although there are also a number of east/ west small streets. Houses on these streets are a combination of two and three story houses, usually in a very simple Federal style. Houses have brick fronts, some of which have been painted light colors. Camac Street contains elements of the physical environment that make most of these small streets stand out. These are:- The narrow size of the street is itself a distinctive feature. - Many of the streets are paved with Belgian block and are listed on
the City’s inventory of historic streets. - Some of the sidewalks are brick, although this is not always
consistent for an entire block. - In spite of their narrow size, most of the blocks have street trees
that add to their character. - These blocks also have landscape improvements. Sometimes there are small planting areas, but more usually window boxes or planters of some form. ***hapter 4 c***A Preservation Alliance Guide for Community Organizations23

## Exercise 4: Define and Describe the Residential Sub-Areas of Your Neighborhood

Create a map similar to that for Washington Square West showing the sub-areas of your neighborhood. Some neighborhoods may have a consistent character throughout the entire neighborhood. In that case, try to identify individual blocks that may stand out for a particular reason. It is not necessary to describe each of the sub-areas in equal detail. Concentrate primarily on the residential sub areas and on the strongest sub-areas or on those that have the most distinctive historic character and give more general descriptions of others. Describe the distinctive physical characteristics of the area – type of housing, architectural styles, yards and open space, porches, roof features etc.— and illustrate with photos that indicate the typical characteristics of each area.For distinctive blocks that stand out from the rest of the neighborhood describe what makes them different and illustrate with a photograph.

# Historic Buildings & Districts

The term “historic” can be confusing when describing buildings and neighborhoods. Is an historic building one that has reached a certain age? Or one where somebody famous lived? Or one designed by a famous architect? All of these can be true, but historic buildings and neighborhoods are not limited to these few categories. In Philadelphia the term “historic building” is usually used to refer to buildings that have been officially recognized by the Philadelphia Historical Commission and listed on the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places. “Historic districts” refer to areas that have also been officially recognized by the Commission and listed on the Philadelphia Register. Alterations or proposals for demolition of historic resources listed on the Philadelphia Register require the approval of the Philadelphia Historical Commission. Historic buildings and districts can also be listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Currently, there are more than 450 individual buildings in Philadelphia listed on the National Register, 75 of which are designated as National Historic Landmarks. In addition, 90 areas of the city containing approximately 22,000 buildings are listed as or have been found eligible to be listed as a National Historic District. Philadelphia also recognizes “conservation districts” — areas that have a coherent architectural character but may not meet the standards to be designated historic districts. In addition, sites of historic events or locations associated with a prominent person can be acknowledged with a state historic marker. Identifying neighborhood historic resources and districts enables residents to become more aware of the historic significance of their neighborhood and may foster civic pride and preservation efforts. It will also contribute to the creation of a citywide preservation plan and the development of District Plans. The following is a brief description of historic resources and districts as they relate to the Philadelphia and National registers, to conservation districts and historic markers. (Sources of more detailed information can be found under *Resources* at the end of this chapter.)

## The Philadelphia Register of Historic Places

### Individual Buildings

The City’s preservation ordinance allows individual buildings, sites, objects and structures and the interior of buildings open or once open to the public all to be listed on the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places. To be eligible building for individual listing an historic resource must meet one of ten criteria listed in the ordinance. These criteria include such factors as being associated with an important historical event; designed by a noteworthy architect or designer; associated with the life of a person significant in the past; or representing a familiar visual feature of a neighborhood. There are currently 4,764 historic resources individually listed on the Philadelphia Register. Examples of such listings include Independence Hall, City Hall, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, sitethe Laurel Hill Cemetery, the Eagle in the Wanamaker Building, the Henry Avenue Bridge and the City Council Chamber in City Hall. Although many historic resources in Philadelphia have already been recognized, there are many, particularly in neighborhoods outside of Center City that have not been identified. To be a significant historic resource and eligible for listing on the Philadelphia Register, a building, site, structure or object does not need to be a specific age or to de designed in a classical object architectural style. It can be anything that embodies the history of the neighborhood and helps define its unique character—a Gothic Revival church from the 1860s, a Beaux-Arts bank building from the 1890s, an Art Deco movie theater from the 1930s or a storefront such as the National Products Building in Old City from the 1950s.

### Districts

The preservation ordinance also allows for the listing of historic districts. structureHistoric districts may consist of a few blocks or an entire neighborhood; the Greenbelt Knoll district contains only 18 properties while the Rittenhouse Fitler district contains over 2,000 properties. All properties in a district are listed on the Philadelphia Register and alterations and proposals for demolition require the approval of the Historical Commission. Historic districts must meet the same type of criteria as individual historic resources. There are currently 12 residential neighborhoods containing 9,737 historic resources listed on the Philadelphia Register: Awbury ArboretumPark Avenue Mall Diamond StreetParkside East Logan StreetRittenhouse-FitlerGirard EstateSociety HillGreenbelt KnollSpring GardenOld CityTudor East FallsNational Products Building

## The National Register of Historic Places

Individual buildings and districts can also be listed on the National Register of Historic Places. To be listed on the National Register individual historic resources or districts must also meet specified criteria including association with significant events or with the lives of significant persons; representative of an important architectural style or designed by a prominent architect. Both individual buildings and buildings in districts must be 50 years of age or older.Many buildings and districts listed on the Philadelphia Register are also listed on the National Register including Independence Hall, City Hall and such historic districts as Society Hill, Rittenhouse- Fitler and
Parkside.Listing on the National Register does not require review of property changes by city, state or federal agencies. However, owners of investment properties (apartment buildings, hotels, commercial properties) listed on the National Register and in National Register Districts are eligible for a 20% tax credit against their federal taxes for the costs entailed in substantial rehabilitation of a listed property.

## Conservation Districts

Some neighborhoods may not have the historic significance or architectural quality to qualify as an historic district but may have such a consistency of architectural character that they can be protected as Conservation Districts. Conservation Districts primarily regulate the character of new construction according to guidelines established by the neighborhood to ensure that new construction is compatible in scale and character with the existing character of the neighborhood. Conservation Districts are created by City Council based on the recommendation of the City Planning Commission, which administers the Conservation District’s guidelines. Thus far, Queen Village is the only conservation district in Philadelphia, but legislation exists to allow other neighborhoods to be so designated with design guidelines to protect the specific character of each neighborhood.

## Historic Markers

Many neighborhoods have been the site of an historic event or a place where a prominent person once lived or worked. The locations of such events or places associated with people — even if the actual places no longer exist — can be noted by the placement of a state historical marker. Historical markers are designated by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission. Historical markers in Philadelphia identify locations associated with a wide variety of people and events, including the house in which Marian
Anderson lived in South Philadelphia, the location where Martin Luther King Jr. spoke in 1968 in West Philadelphia and the former office of prominent Philadelphia architect Louis I. Kahn. The neighborhood analysis should attempt to identify historic resources that help tell the history of the neighborhood, areas that might be suitable for designation as historic districts and conservation districts, and places suitable for historic markers.

### Illustration

Washington Square West is not an ideal neighborhood to use to illustrate historic landmarks and districts because the entire neighborhood is a National Register District and many buildings have been individually listed on the Philadelphia Register. However, to illustrate the concept of how to identify historic landmarks and potential districts, the maps and photographs on the following pages indicate some of the individual landmark buildings in the Washington Square West neighborhood and some of the sub-areas that might be considered historic districts on their own. Each historic site is numbered with the name, address and a brief comment where necessary included in the key.

## Exercise 5: Create an inventory of historic landmarks and potential districts

Create two maps of your neighborhood similar to that of Washington Square. On the first map indicate historic resources in the neighborhood that are already listed on the Philadelphia Register. After marking these locations on the map then add other buildings, sites, structures or objects that are not on the Philadelphia Register but are distinctive and important resources to your neighborhood. Also identify locations that may be suitable for historic markers. In the map key, give the name, address, type of landmark for each location and a short explanation of its importance to the neighborhood; it may be necessary to include this list of information on a separate page. Also provide a photograph of each
landmark.Create a second map to identify areas that might be an historic or conservation district and include one photograph of each potential district.The Preservation Alliance hopes you will submit copies of al the exercises in this handbook to the Alliance. However, whether you do or not we ask that you submit the map, listings and photographs from this chapter. This will enable us to add the historic resources and potential districts in your neighborhood to our citywide inventory of historic resources and contribute to our efforts to create a citywide preservation plan for Philadelphia.You many want to nominate some of these landmarks to the Philadelphia Register yourself. The Alliance’s publication, “How to Nominate a Building Site or Object to the Philadelphia Register,” is available online (see below) or a copy can be obtained by contacting the Preservation Alliance. The Alliance can also provide technical assistance with the preparation of a nomination for an individual building, for an historic district or conservation district, or for an application for an historic marker.

# Preparing a Grant Application to the Preservation Alliance

The Preservation Alliance provides grants ranging from $1,000 to $5,000 for neighborhood preservation projects and grants of $30,000 for neighborhood improvement projects through its Vital Neighborhoods Initiative. Applicants for grants of $1,000 to $5,000 must complete at least the neighborhood description and the analysis of historic buildings and districts described in chapters 2 and 5 of this guide to be eligible for a grant. Other application requirements are described in the Guidelines for Small Grant Applications that can be obtained from the Preservation Alliance. The Alliance also provides grants of up to $30,000 and Service Grants in partnership with the Community Design Collaborative to invited organizations through its Vital Neighborhoods Initiative. Applicants for one of these grants must complete all of the exercises in chapters 1 through 5 as well as the exercises in this chapter to be eligible for a grant. An example of how a community organization completed these exercises is included in Appendix B. Applicants for a Vital Neighborhoods grant to improve the public environment are required to identify a target area and a specific block on which the organization intends to focus. Projects should focus on improving residential blocks in the target area, working on a block by block basis. Improvement to the public environment can include facade improvements and improvements to private property that contribute to the public environment.The Vital Neighborhoods Initiative is intended to improve neighborhood conditions and market values of residential properties by working outward from the strongest sections of the neighborhood. The analysis of residential sub-areas in Chapter 4 should have helped identify that section or sections of the neighborhood that have the greatest strengths and the factors that make that section or sections stand out from other parts of the neighborhood. If there are opportunities to improve this section of the neighborhood, then it might be selected as the target area and a block would be selected in that area. On the other hand, if the strongest section of the neighborhood is already sufficiently well developed, then it might be appropriate to examine the factors that make it such a strong area and explore whether these factors can be replicated on an adjacent block or on a block in another section of the neighborhood that already has some strengths but could benefit from improvements.

In the Washington Square West example, the two blocks of Clinton Street were identified as the strongest section of the neighborhood. These blocks needed no further improvement. Therefore, it would be appropriate to look for another target area. A primary reason why Clinton Street was considered such a strong area was the landscaped areas in front of each house, window boxes and brick sidewalks that complimented the historic character of the houses. In this case it would be appropriate to look at other strong blocks in the neighborhood to see if similar improvements on those blocks might enhance their quality and lead to improved residential property values. This would lead to the selection of one or more of those blocks as the target area. The project might then include a landscape improvement plan using a Vital Neighborhoods Initiative grant as a matching grant to encourage all homeowners to implement a program of landscape improvements, such as street tree planting, brick sidewalks, window boxes or something similar. Small streets were also identified as areas of strength in the neighborhood. Another approach to selecting a target area could be to select a block on a small street in need of improvement. The selection of a target area should arise out of the analysis of residential sub-areas in Chapter 4. It should be a relatively small area consisting of a few blocks where an impact can be created in one to two years. The selection of a project should involve the residents of the target area blocks and be informed by characteristics of the strongest sections of the neighborhood.

## Target Area and Block

Since Clinton Street and the small streets are the strongest areas of the neighborhood an illustrative target area has been selected close to Clinton Street and one that includes a small street in need of improvement so as to try to build off these existing neighborhood strengths. The target blocks are the 900 block of Spruce Street and the 200 block of South Hutchinson Street (see Map 5).

### Project, Part 1

The south side of the 900 block of Spruce Street is Portico Row, a distinctive row of houses with projecting porticos and high front steps (see photo). These houses have small fenced-in courtyards in between the high front steps that are either landscaped or paved. This adds a distinctive feature to the south side of the street. However, the north side of the street has no distinctive qualities even though it has some very distinctive houses (see photo)

The proposed project is to encourage property owners on the north side of the 900 block to incorporate some of the landscape features from Clinton Street. This would include:

- Creating small planting areas in between the projection front stairs of adjacent houses.
- Adding window boxes and shutters where consistent with the historic style of the house.
- Examining locations for additional street trees.This part of the project would offer property owners matching grants to make these improvements, notably the sidewalk planting areas.

### Project, Part 2

The second part of the project targets the intersection of Spruce Street and South Hutchinson Street. South Hutchinson Street is not as distinctive as many of the other small streets in part because the south end at Spruce is in poor condition. The second part of the project might be to work with property owners here to improve conditions, also through the use of matching grants. These efforts would include:- Working with the owner of the corner property on Spruce Street to either remove the stucco and restore the brick, or to paint the stucco a different and more attractive color, and to reorganize parking to create a landscape area along South Hutchinson Street (See photos).- Working with the owners of the small row houses on the east side to improve facades (through matching façade improvement grants) and to improve the sidewalk and planting areas. (See photos).

## Exercise 6: Identify a target area and select an initial project

Based on the information about sub-areas you identified in Chapter 4, identify a section of the neighborhood that will be your target area for improvement. The target area should be small, consisting of a few residential blocks that already have strengths or are located close to the strongest blocks in the neighborhood. An improvement program might be implemented over several years and involve several different types of projects. Identify the target area on a map and provide a summary description of the proposed project or projects that you would like to implement in the area, identifying which project would be the initial undertaking. Projects should focus on improving a residential block and have resident involvement in planning and implementing the project.In addition to this map and project summary, more detailed information about the project, its cost and time schedule for implementation is required for the Vital Neighborhoods Initiative grant application. The additional information required is described in the grant application guidelines.
