# Introduction

##Purpose of this guide

How to Look at Your Neighborhood is intended to assist residents and neighborhood organizations in analyzing the physical character and strengths of the neighborhood in which they live or which they represent. The guide has three primary objectives, reflecting the mission and programs of the Preservation Alliance.

To assist residents and neighborhood organizations:

1. identifying the distinctive physical characteristics of their neighborhood worthy of preservation, including historic buildings and potential historic or conservation districts that might be appropriate to include in a citywide preservation plan for Philadelphia.
2, identifying the distinctive physical characteristics and strengths of their neighborhood and define projects for grant applications to the Preservation Alliance or others.
3. identifying the distinctive physical characteristics of their neighborhood and historic resources that might be appropriate to include in District Plans prepared by the Philadelphia City Planning Commission.

The first objective may result in findings that lead to the nomination of buildings or districts to the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places to ensure that they are protected from demolition or adverse alteration, or to the creation of a conservation district or to the preparation of an application for an historic marker or to undertake other activities that explore and celebrate the history of the neighborhood. The analysis might also encourage residents to participate in workshops provided by the Alliance to learn how to maintain an historic property or to attend the Old House Fair.

The second objective is intended to assist residents and community organizations with completion of the analysis required to apply for a grant from the Preservation Alliance or others. A Preservation Alliance Guide for Community Organizations.

The third objective is intended to help residents and community organizations to be better prepared to work with the Philadelphia City Planning Commission on the development of a District Plan that will include their neighborhood. The City Planning Commission intends to create 18 District Plans covering the entire city over a period of five years. A map of the 18 districts and the City Planning Commission’s schedule can be found at www.phila2035.org.

The guide describes how to analyze a neighborhood and record certain basic information on maps supplemented by digital photographs. Appendix B illustrates how one neighborhood organization used the guide to prepare a submission to the Preservation Alliance.

## How to use this guide

Many neighborhood organizations have developed neighborhood plans working with professional consultants. These are valuable documents and contain valuable information. This guide is not intended to result in a neighborhood plan. It encourages a “grass-roots” approach to neighborhood analysis that can be undertaken by residents and may contribute to a neighborhood plan or to other purposes.

This guide encourages resident participation in the gathering of information about the neighborhood.

1. In order to develop a community consensus on neighborhood character, strengths and historic assets it is helpful to begin with as many different points of view on these issues as possible. The neighborhood analysis requires certain information be gathered by walking or driving around and looking at the neighborhood from a new perspective. For this part of the analysis we recommended that teams of community residents be organized with the number of teams dependent on the size of the neighborhood.
 - For a small neighborhood each team could examine the entire neighborhood, in which case it would be desirable to have two or three teams to be sure to get different points of view.
 - A larger neighborhood could be divided into two or three sections with two or three teams examining each section. The analysis can also be done by an individual. It is also an exercise that can be done by high school students or young adults, whose view of the neighborhood would be valuable to have. The objective of this stage of the process is to get as many different points of view on the components of the analysis as possible in order to see similarities and differences.
- Each team should produce the types of maps suggested in this guide and document its observations and conclusions with digital photographs that can be shared with the other teams.
- One part of the analysis requires an historical and current description of the neighborhood. This requires research, much of which can be done via the Internet, and might be completed by a separate team or an individual.
2. Once each team has completed its analysis, all teams should come together and each present the results of its analysis to the other participants. This might be done at a community meeting or in a workshop format with other residents participating who did not take part in the analysis. The objective is to create a community discussion about the character of the neighborhood by sharing observations and finding out where there is agreement and where there are differences of opinion that need to be discussed until consensus can be reached.
3. The results of this process can then be recorded in the format suggested in this guide as a community perspective on the neighborhood that can be shared with other residents. It can also contribute information to the Preservation Alliance’s development of an inventory of historic resources and potential historic districts, and that can serve as a basis for discussions with the City Planning Commission about a District Plan and zoning remapping.

## Components of the Process

The guide defines a step-by-step process for looking at your neighborhood by completing a series of exercises, each of which are described and then illustrated with an actual neighborhood example. The guide uses information about the Washington Square West neighborhood to illustrate the approach to each of the six components, while also introducing elements from other neighborhoods to help understand the broader range of architectural styles and building types found in Philadelphia neighborhoods.

The components of the suggested process are defined and illustrated in the chapters listed below. The first five chapters are most relevant to a general understanding of the neighborhood, to contributing data to the Preservation Alliance for a citywide preservation plan, for applying for a small grant from the Preservation Alliance, and for working with the City Planning Commission on District Plans. The sixth chapter is most relevant to organizations seeking a grant from the Preservation Alliance.

1. Defining Neighborhood Boundaries and Context
2. Describing Neighborhood History and Current Conditions
3. Defining General Land Use Patterns
4. Describing Residential Sub-areas and their Character
5. Identifying Historic Landmarks and Districts
