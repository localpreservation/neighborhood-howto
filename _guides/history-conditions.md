title: "Understanding neighborhood history and present conditions"
---

Philadelphia neighborhoods have grown and changed over long periods of time. Some neighborhoods date back to the 1700s and the founding of the city, others were created in the 19th and 20th centuries as the city expanded. In some cases many of the original buildings remain, in others, later periods of development have changed the area to what it is today.

Old City, for example, was the earliest residential neighborhood of Philadelphia. Within its boundaries were houses, churches, shops, schools and other facilities. Over time, as the population moved westward, many of the older buildings were demolished and replaced by commercial buildings for wholesale and manufacturing use. In the mid-20th century those buildings were converted to apartments and condominiums.

Neighborhoods today contain elements from many periods of growth and development. Understanding this history and the patterns of development of the neighborhood helps to identify what is important from the past to preserve. It also recognizes that neighborhoods continue to change, with new elements being added and older buildings often being adapted to uses very different from their original purpose.

The history of Philadelphia neighborhoods is well documented in photographs, atlases and maps. Historic photographs give a sense of what the community was like in the past and often show buildings that once existed and have been replaced by subsequent development or how buildings have been adapted to other uses over time. Maps and atlases from different historic periods contain a wealth of information and are a fascinating way to examine the evolution of a neighborhood. One of the best sources for maps and atlases is the Greater Philadelphia Geo History Network’s website site. It contains maps and atlases from approximately the 1600s to the present time. Maps from different years may be superimposed on one another to see how a neighborhood and individual properties have changed over time.

It is also important to understand how the population of a neighborhood has changed over time to show social and ethnic history and the places that may be associated with changing social and ethnic patterns. Census data for different historic periods provides basic data on population and demographic characteristics, and recent publications describe the movement of racial and ethnic groups from one section of the city to another.

Appendix A contains a short description of the history of the Washington Square West neighborhood. The description is organized by chronological periods with a brief description of the key changes that occurred at different points in time. It ends with a general description of the neighborhood today. The chronological time periods used in the Washington Square West example may not be applicable to all neighborhoods. It is important that the time periods identified are relevant to your specific neighborhood’s history. The written description is supplemented by historic maps and historic photographs. Appendix B contains a description of the history of the Belmont Village neighborhood also supplemented with historic maps.
